# Bioinformatics Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This repository contains machine learning scripts for a bioinformatics project. The project aims to predict gene expression based on various features. The dataset used originates from a study on TiO2 Nanoparticle toxicity.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data

The dataset used in this project is based on a study of gene expression levels. You'll need to place your dataset in the same directory as the scripts and name it according to the filenames specified in the scripts. The dataset should contain columns for gene expression levels, and various other biological parameters.

## Scripts

1. **preprocessing steps.py**: This script contains code for data preprocessing, including handling missing values, scaling, and normalization.
  
2. **summary statistics after imputation.py**: This script provides summary statistics for the dataset after imputation.
  
3. **Preprocessed_training_data.py**: This is the initial training data preprocessing script.
  
4. **Preprocessed_training_data_2.py**: This is the updated version of the training data preprocessing script.
  
5. **Predections_1.py**: This script is used for making predictions based on the machine learning model.
  
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning.py**: This script is used for hyperparameter tuning of the machine learning model.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have all the prerequisites installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Place your dataset in the same directory as the scripts.
4. Run each script in the order specified above.

## Results Interpretation

The machine learning model will output predictions, and performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) will be displayed. These metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
