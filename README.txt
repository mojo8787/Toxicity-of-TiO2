Microarray Data Analysis for Criminal Case Against K.D.
Introduction
This project aims to analyze microarray gene expression data related to a criminal case against K.D. The goal is to identify significant genes and pathways for further investigation.

Installation
To run the scripts, ensure that you have the following Python packages installed:

Pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
You can install them using pip:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Usage
Data Preprocessing
preprocessing.py: Handles missing values and normalizes the data.
Data Imputation
imputation.py: Imputes missing values in the dataset.
(Additional scripts and their usage can be added as the project progresses)

To run a script, navigate to the script's directory and execute:

bash
Copy code
python <script_name>.py
File Structure
/data: Contains the raw and processed data files.
/code: Houses the Python scripts for analysis.
/figures: Will contain any generated figures.
/docs: Contains additional documentation.
Data Files
GSE156564_series_matrix.txt: Original microarray data.
processed_data.csv: Processed data after preprocessing and imputation.
